"""The studio's language model: Gemini through Google AI Studio's free tier first, then free models from other
providers through their OpenAI-compatible APIs (PROVIDERS), and Cursor's agent models (cursor_llm.py, with the
channel's Cursor key) when none of those can answer. YTC_LLM_FIRST=cursor puts Cursor first.

Gemini answers in about 15 seconds and Cursor in 2 to 5 minutes, which is most of what a Short costs on the runner.

Each Gemini model has its own free quota on the AI Studio project of aksha.shivam18@gmail.com (Flash models: 5 requests a minute
and 20 a day; Flash Lite: 15 a minute and 500 a day), so a run steps down a ladder as models run out. Everything
starts on Flash but the picture checks, which start on Flash Lite; once Flash is spent, the review waits for its
reset while plenty of Shorts are ready (studio.review), and the rest goes on with the models below it.

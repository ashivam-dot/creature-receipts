"""Run the studio on Modal's monthly credit instead of on a laptop or an Actions runner.

`studio_run` is the studio itself: four times a day it runs `ytc auto` on a fresh clone of the repo and pushes
what changed. `studio_episode` makes a whole Short (research to hosting) from a snapshot of the repo, so a run can
start several and exit instead of waiting; the next run collects what they left in the results volume.
`render_episode` renders one spec. `slot_watch` sends a post Buffer just failed again, minutes after its slot.
